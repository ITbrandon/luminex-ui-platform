# Luminex UI Platform

A modern, enterprise-grade **UI component library** built with **Lit.js Web Components** and demonstrated in a **React + Vite** dashboard. Luminex is designed to be **framework-agnostic, visually vibrant, accessible**, and **reusable across multiple internal applications**.

---

## 🌈 Design Philosophy

Luminex prioritizes:

- **Vibrant, modern visual design**  
- **Clear hierarchy and spacing**  
- **Accessible interactions** (ARIA, keyboard navigation)  
- **Framework independence** for seamless React and HTML usage  
- **Enterprise-grade scalability** for internal dashboards  

Components are designed to feel like a real **internal product platform**, not a tutorial or placeholder site.
